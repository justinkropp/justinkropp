### Hi there ðŸ¤˜

Iâ€™m a Graphic Designer turned Product Designer with 20 years of experience spanning graphic design, product design, user research, and strategy. Much of my work focuses on projects that live at the intersection of design, technology, and systems. I frame my work through the lens of strategic inquiry and multidisciplinary human-centered design.

I'm currently a Staff Product Designer at Vercel.
