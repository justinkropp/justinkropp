## Who

I'm a graphic designer and writer based out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. I studied design at [Maryland Institute College of Art](https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/graphic-design-mfa/), where I received my MFA in Graphic Design in 2010.

My work spans human interface design, writing, and research.

I am currently a _Staff Product Designer_ at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/design) — previously at Modern Treasury, Okta, Mozilla, and Automattic — designing features and building novel experiences with multidiscplinary teams.
