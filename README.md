## Who

I'm a graphic designer and writer based out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. I studied design at Maryland Institute College of Art, where I received my MFA in Graphic Design in 2010.

My work spans human interface design, writing, research, systems design and stewardship, and conversational ui.

I am currently a _Staff Product Designer_ at Vercel — previously at Modern Treasury, Okta, Mozilla, and Automattic — designing features and building novel experiences with multidiscplinary teams.
