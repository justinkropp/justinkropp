## Who

I'm a graphic designer and writer based out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. I studied design at Maryland Institute College of Art, where I received my MFA in Graphic Design in 2010.

My work spans human interface design, writing, research, systems design and stewardship, and conversational ui. I'm interested in creating meaningful experiences at the interseciton of art and design.

I am currently a product designer at Vercel — previously at Modern Treasury, Mozilla, and Automattic — designing features and novel experiences with multidiscplinary teams.
